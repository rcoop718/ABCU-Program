# ABCU-Program

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  For this project, the problem I was solving was to sort and print out a list of school courses in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  To approach this problem I did an analysis of the run-time and memory of three different data structures, vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Data structures are important to understand because they work together with algorithm design and problem-solving. Different data structures work better for differnt programs so it is good to know a couple different ones.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  To overcome roadblocks I used google to search explanations of how each data structures are used and common ways on how to code them. This helped me a lot throughout this project.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  
  I have found that designing software and programs is much easier when pseudocode is written first. This way I can think through the program processes, then I can code the program without trying to do both at the same time.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  During my time on this project, I worked hard trying to comment each function so it was easy to come back and understand the program. I also tried my best to break down functions into basic processes so that functions can be reused, instead of rewritten multiple times. Both of these idea help keep my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable for later use.
